// Book class
- Represents a book entity with an 'id' and 'title'.
- Used to store book information in the application.

// CreateBook class
- Data transfer object (DTO) for creating a new book.
- Contains a 'title' field.
- Used to receive book creation requests through the API.

// BookApi class
- RESTful API controller for book-related operations.
- Handles HTTP requests and returns responses.
- Uses BookService to delegate book creation.

// BookService class
- Provides business logic for book-related operations.
- Uses an IdGenerator to generate unique book IDs.
- Manages a list of books and provides methods to create books.

// IdGenerator class
- Generates unique IDs for books.
- Utilizes UUID.randomUUID() to generate random IDs.
- Prepend the generated IDs with "BOOK-ID-" for book-specific IDs.

Application Summary:
- Simple book management system using Spring Boot.
- Create books through the RESTful API provided by BookApi.
- BookService handles book creation, assigns unique IDs, and stores them.
- IdGenerator generates unique IDs for each book.
- Book and CreateBook classes define the book entity and DTO respectively.

Possible Future Additions:
- Implement additional endpoints for updating, deleting, or retrieving specific books.
- Add validation and error handling for API inputs to ensure data integrity.
- Introduce a database or persistence layer for storing books persistently.
- Implement pagination and sorting features for retrieving multiple books.
- Include authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure book management.
- Add unit tests and integration tests for code quality and reliability.

Spring Boot Benefits:
- Fast development and increased productivity.
- Auto-configuration and dependency injection.
- Efficient handling of HTTP requests.
- Suitable for building robust and scalable applications.
